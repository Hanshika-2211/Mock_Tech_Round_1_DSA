Q.) Write a function that reverses a singly linked list in-place and returns the reversed list. Additionally, implement a function to detect if the linked list has a loop and remove the loop if present. You must handle both the reversal and cycle detection/removal in O(n) time complexity.
Do not use any additional data structures like arrays or hash sets.
